## About forks
Forking a repository makes an exact copy another project that resides on your personal account. This acts as a connection between your own repo and the owner's repo. Additionally, this allows the owner to protect their own code by preventing users from pushing to it directly but still giving developers a way to contribute in a non-intrusive way. Forking is very common in open-source software development.

Back on the forked repository page, you should see a yellow bar at the top with a button to "Compare and Pull Request". Click that button.

After clicking that button, take some time to enter in a good description to help the owner of the project decide what it is we are trying to contribute.

We will see a list of commit messages and that our branch is "ahead" of the master branch.

Click "Create Pull Request". The owner of the project will get an email notification that some changes have been made and that a pull request is ready for their review.

The owner can approve or reject the pull request and optionally add some additional comments for your review. While this is a simple edit we are making to the readme.md file, you can imagine a situation where your code would require some additional review.
