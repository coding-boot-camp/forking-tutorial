## About forks
Forking a repository makes an exact copy another project that resides on your personal account. This acts as a connection between your own repo and the owner's repo. Additionally, this allows the owner to protect their own code by preventing users from pushing to it directly but still giving developers a way to contribute in a non-intrusive way. Forking is very common in open-source software development.

## About permissions and visibility of forks
The permissions and visibility of forks depend on whether the upstream repository is public or private, and whether it is owned by an organization.

## Configuring a remote repository for a fork
You must configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git to sync changes you make in a fork with the original repository. This also allows you to sync changes made in the original repository with the fork.

## Syncing a fork
Sync a fork of a repository to keep it up-to-date with the upstream repository.

## Allowing changes to a pull request branch created from a fork
For greater collaboration, you can allow commits on branches you've created from forks owned by your personal account.

## What happens to forks when a repository is deleted or changes visibility?
Deleting your repository or changing its visibility affects that repository's forks.
