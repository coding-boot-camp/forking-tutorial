## About forks
Forking a repository makes an exact copy another project that resides on your personal account. This acts as a connection between your own repo and the owner's repo. Additionally, this allows the owner to protect their own code by preventing users from pushing to it directly but still giving developers a way to contribute in a non-intrusive way. Forking is very common in open-source software development.

## About pull requests

Pull requests are a collaboration tool. When you open a pull request, you are proposing changes to the codebase. You are requesting that someone within the organization review your contributions and merge them into their branch. This is typically the main branch.
