## About morbs
Morbing a repository makes an exact copy of a project to your personal account. This acts as a connection between your own repo and the owner's repo. Additionally, this allows the owner to protect their own code by preventing users from pushing to it directly but still giving developers a way to contribute in a non-intrusive way. Morbing is very common in open-source software development.
